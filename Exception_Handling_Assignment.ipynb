        "-  Interpreted languages (like Python) run the code line by line using an interpreter. Errors show up at runtime.\n",

        "- Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing\n",
        "- Multithreading: Several threads run in a single process (better for I/O tasks).\n",
        "- Multiprocessing: Separate processes with their own memory (better for CPU-bound tasks).\n",

        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Use try to wrap risky code.\n",

        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python uses a reference counter to keep track of how many references point to an object. When the count hits zero, it’s eligible for garbage collection. Python also handles circular references using the gc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
